# Arcade Space Shooter
Using Python Arcade to create a classic space shooter game. 

There are varying colored enemies, and depending on the color, the enemy will have a certain amount of health and its bullets will do a certain amount of damage. To balance this, harder enemies will provide more points when killed. Blue enemies are the weakest, followed by green, orange, and black. The enemies will move randomly around the screen, and will fire at set rates.

The user can move his spaceship using the mouse, albeit limited to the lower part of the screen. Pressing and holding the mouse button will let the player shoot, and releasing will stop the shooting. The game runs infinitely until the player dies, and the main goal of the game is to try to get as high of a score before dying.
